# 🧠 Interview Automation (Open-Source Prototype)

This repository contains the open-source version of my original Interview Automation Platform — built to showcase the core workings and prototype of the system.  
The full project is non-open-source due to proprietary components and integrations, but this repo demonstrates the concept, architecture, and base implementation of how the system functions.  

# 🚀 Project Overview

Interview Automation is a next-gen platform that enables companies to conduct AI-driven automated interviews for shortlisted candidates — completely online, with real-time integrity checks and intelligent scoring.    
### In this open-source version, you’ll find a simplified prototype that illustrates:  
- Candidate login and resume upload  
- Dynamic, AI-generated questions using LLMs  
- Evaluation pipeline for knowledge, confidence & role suitability  
- Basic monitoring features (camera access & tab-switch detection)  
- Interview session recording (concept demonstration)  

## 💡 Core Features (in Full Project)  
Feature	Description  
- 🤖 AI Interviewer	LLM-powered interviewer that asks role-specific, adaptive questions  
- 📄 Resume Parsing	Extracts key skills and experience to tailor the interview flow  
- 📹 Integrity System	Monitors camera and detects tab switches to prevent misconduct  
- 🧮 Candidate Scoring	Evaluates candidates on multiple parameters — knowledge, confidence, and fit   
- 📊 Admin Dashboard	Provides data-driven insights and recorded interview sessions for recruiters  

## 🧩 This Open-Source Prototype Includes  
- Frontend + basic backend setup
- Simplified candidate flow
- Sample LLM-based Q&A pipeline (mocked for demonstration)
- Minimal design for quick setup and understanding

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

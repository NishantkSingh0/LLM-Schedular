# 🧠 Interview Automation (Open-Source Prototype)

This repository contains the open-source version of my original Interview Automation Platform — built to showcase the core workings and prototype of the system.
The full project is non-open-source due to proprietary components and integrations, but this repo demonstrates the concept, architecture, and base implementation of how the system functions.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Interview Automation is a next-gen platform that enables companies to conduct AI-driven automated interviews for shortlisted candidates — completely online, with real-time integrity checks and intelligent scoring.  
### In this open-source version, you’ll find a simplified prototype that illustrates:
- Candidate login and resume upload
- Dynamic, AI-generated questions using LLMs
- Evaluation pipeline for knowledge, confidence & role suitability
- Basic monitoring features (camera access & tab-switch detection)
- Interview session recording (concept demonstration)

## 💡 Core Features (in Full Project)
Feature	Description
- 🤖 AI Interviewer	LLM-powered interviewer that asks role-specific, adaptive questions
- 📄 Resume Parsing	Extracts key skills and experience to tailor the interview flow
- 📹 Integrity System	Monitors camera and detects tab switches to prevent misconduct
- 🧮 Candidate Scoring	Evaluates candidates on multiple parameters — knowledge, confidence, and fit
- 📊 Admin Dashboard	Provides data-driven insights and recorded interview sessions for recruiters

## 🧩 This Open-Source Prototype Includes  
- Frontend + basic backend setup
- Simplified candidate flow
- Sample LLM-based Q&A pipeline (mocked for demonstration)
- Minimal design for quick setup and understanding

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React / Next.js
- **Backend**: Django / Node.js (simplified for open-source)
- **AI Layer**: OpenAI / Hugging Face APIs (demo mode)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite (for prototype)
- **Monitoring**: Browser APIs for camera and tab tracking

## 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

**This repo is not the full product, but a demonstration build created to:**
- Explain the project’s architecture and workflow
- Show how AI-driven interview automation works
- Provide an educational and reference example for developers and recruiters
